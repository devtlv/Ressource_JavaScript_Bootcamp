- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master-ebook-dp-B003GCTQAE/dp/B003GCTQAE/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=): Ever heard of [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) or [don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)? Andrew Hunt and David Thomas popularized these ideas within their book, **_The Pragmatic Programmer_**, as they first walk the reader through the type of _mindset_ and _tools_ one should implement before _writing code_. From there they delve deep into best practices for _writing code_ (testing, refactoring, clean and performant code, using Big-O to estimate algorithm runtime, weighing costs and benefits before implementing something, etc.), followed by _project management_. Although it came out in 1999, it still holds its own as a practical and relevant book in the modern world.
